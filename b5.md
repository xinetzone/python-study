We biologically classified all the creatures in the region we plant trees according to the taxon kingdom shown on the right. Double click each taxon will isolate the species to help better visualize the location of each taxon kingdom. The taxon class shown on the left are more detailed sub-species of the creatures and can be isolated or vanished by clicking interaction. The trees our program planted improve the ecological environment there and serve the survival of these wild plants.
