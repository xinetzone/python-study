The following two figures show the comparison of the Tree cover loss index and biomass loss index between Fianarantsoa and other regions. We can see that only in Fianarantsoa, the changes in Tree cover loss and Biomass loss are the same. So, it shows that Tree plays a very important role in the local aboveground biomass. When the number of trees increases, the survival of the local biomass will also increase. If other regions have more and more donated trees, then the biomass in these regions will also be more protected.
